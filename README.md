# EnthusiasticMoose

Exercise for practicing the basics of C#. We created a moose in the terminal that:
* First: told us about himself
* Second: asked question that a user was prompted to answer.
* Third: The moose took the place of a magic 8 ball that would randomize an answer after a user asked the Moose.
